	* Added new bitmaps for tool panel. Using BMP format. Files
	related to core componetns are in plugins/bitmaps, while toolbook
	tab bitmaps are in the old src-images. Will think about better
	directory structure. Implemented new tool panel using Toolbook.

	* Undo/redo fixes, using UndoGlobal as a temporaty solution for
	non-implemented undos; added maketools script for auto-generating
	tool panel bitmaps; reusing old tool panel in tools.py at the
	moment until the new one is ready

	* Some undo/redo refactoring. This are messy at the moment but it
	is already working for simple actions (Delete, Panel edit if not
	followed by selecting other items).

	* 'name' parameter in Component was confusion, renamed to 'klass';
	style/exstyle granted separate notebook panels with checkboxes
	(params.StylePanel class); simplified attribute panel construction

	* Implemented Replace command including underlying logic for
	passing compatible attributes and child objects from the old to
	the new component

	* Bitmap and Icon support, renamed 'root' menu to 'TOP_LEVEL'
	(top-level components), 'ROOT' reserved for menu items added
	before submenus; special attribute with empty name used for
	node-level data (such as in wxBitmap); fixed bitmap param data
	editing; added fallback to auto-registered generic component if a
	reistered one not found; correct notebook parent/child group; etc.

	* first stage of test window refactoring: moved test frame
	creation to the top-level components (makeTestWin method); fixed
	pull-down menu populating by adding only relevant entries;
	implemented more core components (wxDialog, wxToolBar, wxMenuBar);
	more logic in child/sibling modes
